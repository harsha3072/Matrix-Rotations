You are given a square matrix A of dimensions NxN. You need to apply the below given 3 operations on the matrix A.

Rotation: It is represented as R S where S is an integer in (90, 180, 270, 360, 450, ...) which denotes the number of degrees to rotate. You need to rotate the matrix A by angle S in the clockwise direction. The angle of rotation(S) will always be in multiples of 90 degrees.

Update: It is represented as UXY Z. In initial matrix A (as given in
input), you need to update the element at row index X and column index Y with value Z. 
After the update, all the previous rotation operations have to be applied to the updated initial matrix..

Querying: It is represented as QKL. You need to print the value at row index K and column index L of the matrix A.

Input

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next N lines contain N space-separated integers Aij (i-index of the row, index of the column).

Next lines contain various operations on the array. Each operation on each line (Beginning either with R, U or Q).

-1 will represent the end of input.

Output

For each Query operation print the element present at row index K and colum index L of the matrix in its current state.

Initial Matrix

3 4

For R 90, clockwise rotation by 90 degrees, the matrix will become

3 1

4 2

For Q 0 0, print the element at row index 0 and column index 0 of A, which is 3.

For Q 0 1, print the element at row index 0 and column index 1 of A, which is 1.

Again for R 90, clockwise rotation by 90 degrees, the matrix will become

4 3

2 1

For Q 0 0, print the element at row index O and column index 0 of A, which is 4.

For U 0 0 6, update the value at row index O and column index 0 in the initial matrix to 6. So the updated matrix will be,

6 2

3 4

After updating, we need to rotate the matrix by sum of all rotation angles applied till now (i.e. R 90 and R 90 90 90 180 degrees in clockwise direction).

After rotation the matrix will now become

4 3

2 6

Next for Q 1 1, print the element at row index 1 and column index 1 of A, which is 6.

So the output should be
